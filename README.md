# 🌍Exploring the World DataBase using SQL 📈

## 📋 Overview
In this project, I used SQL to query the World Database. Through a series of exercises, I navigated SQL fundamentals, from basic `SELECT` queries to advanced `JOIN` operations. By engaging with real-world data, I aimed to deepen my understanding of SQL's role in managing relational databases. This project not only enhanced my proficiency in SQL syntax but also provided insights into its practical applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Master SQL fundamentals through hands-on exercises.
- Understand the practical applications of SQL in managing relational databases.
- Develop advanced querying skills, including complex `JOIN` operations.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Basic Queries**: Learned and applied basic `SELECT` statements to retrieve data.
- **Filtering Data**: Utilized `WHERE` clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.
- **Sorting Results**: Implemented `ORDER BY` clauses to sort query results.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Applied functions like `COUNT`,`MIN`, and `MAX` to perform calculations on data.
- **Group By**: Used `GROUP BY` to aggregate data.
- **Subqueries**: Embedded queries within queries to perform complex data retrievals.
- **Join Operation**:Applied 'JOIN' clause to combine data from multiple tables.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **📜 Scripts**: Contains SQL scripts for each exercise and lesson.
- **📊 Data**: Includes sample data files used for querying.
- **📝 Documentation**: Detailed explanations and insights gained from each exercise.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of SQL and its capabilities in managing and querying relational databases. Through practical exercises and real-world data, I gained valuable skills in SQL syntax and its applications, preparing me for more advanced database management tasks.
